# My Awesome Project
A Pick-Your-Own Adventure game based in the terminal where you try and survive Shia LeBeouf! This was heavily inspired by the song by Rob Cantor called 'Shia LeBeouf' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0u4M6vppCI)


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about how to interact with the terminal and make a story seem better formatted, especially when it came to showing the options the reader could take.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
