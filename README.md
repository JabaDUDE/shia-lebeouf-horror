# My Awesome Project
A Pick-Your-Own Adventure game based in the terminal where you try and survive Shia LeBeouf! This was heavily inspired by the song by Rob Cantor called 'Shia LeBeouf' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0u4M6vppCI)


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about how to interact with the terminal and make a story seem better formatted, especially when it came to showing the options the reader could take. I used a Class, since I always spell Shia LeBeouf's last name wrong. But I also wanted to dip my toes into OOP as I have ideas for a more complex terminal game in the future.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
